\subsection{Perspective Warp} \label{subsec:perspective_observations}
Perspective warping or transforms, as mentioned in \autoref{subsec:perspective_warp}, can change the desired area of an image to be the focal point, as if you were looking at it straight on.  This is a very useful feature in image recognition as it allows you to select a feature to look at without distortions from being at an angle, or far away.  For instance, we could do a perspective to make it appear as if the camera is looking down somewhat.
