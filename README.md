**Installation:**

We included a requirements.txt file so you to install all dependencies simply run

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt ```

**Runnning:**
To run, simply call start main.

Via terminal, inside the root directory of the repo:  

```$ ./main```

**Usage:**
First, you will need to select a file using the "open file" option.  Once a file has been loaded, you can
perform operations on the image as desired using the buttons to the left.  There is no "undo" option, so any
transformations done will either need to be undone yourself or the file reloaded if you wish to undo.

Once you have transformed your image as desired, you can select the "save file" option to save the image
and it's transformations as a separate file.

Zooming: click on the zoom button to toggle zoom mode, then hover over the image and left click to zoom in and right click to zoom out
